Project Title: "Whispers in the Walls"

Game Concept:
The player takes on the role of an urban explorer who has entered a long-abandoned mansion rumored to be haunted. With only a flashlight in hand, the player must navigate the mansion, uncovering its dark secrets, all while being pursued by an unseen entity.

Features and Mechanics:

First-Person Perspective:

Explore the game from a first-person view to immerse the player in the environment.
Limited Visibility:

Use a flashlight to illuminate the dark mansion. The battery life is limited, and spare batteries are scarce.
Some rooms might be pitch-black, requiring the player to rely on sound and memory.

Environmental Puzzles:

The mansion contains locked rooms and secret passages. Solve puzzles to access new areas.
Reading notes and journals will provide hints to puzzles and also reveal the backstory.
Atmospheric Sound Design:

Use ambient noises like creaking floors, distant whispers, and gusts of wind.
Footsteps or whispers can hint at the unseen entity's proximity.

The Unseen Entity:

An entity pursues the player. Its presence is hinted at through sounds, moving objects, and chilling drafts.
Direct encounters are rare but deadly. Players must hide or evade detection.

Sanity Mechanic:

Prolonged darkness, encountering the entity, or witnessing unsettling events reduce the player's sanity.
Reduced sanity affects gameplay: distorted vision, hallucinations, or hearing misleading sounds.

Player Feedback:

Visual cues like the flashlight flickering or the screen distorting indicate battery life and sanity level.
Use subtle music changes to signal danger or puzzle completion.

Dynamic Game Ending:

Based on actions taken, puzzles solved, or notes read, offer multiple game endings. It encourages replayability.
Graphics and Polish:

Utilize dynamic lighting and shadows to create a moody environment.
Add particle effects for things like dust motes or the player's visible breath in cold rooms.

Publishing:


When designing a horror game, pacing is crucial. Ensure the player has moments of tension broken up by quieter moments of exploration and puzzle-solving. The fear of the unknown can often be more effective than any visible threat.
